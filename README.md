# HARMONiE
HierARchical MOdelliNg of Eclipses. 

This respository contains the code I used in Keating and Cowan 2021, located here https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00010.pdf, in case anyone wants to reproduce the analysis.

I used PyMC3 to analyze 10 secondary eclipses of the eccentric hot Jupiter XO-3b using a hierarchical model on the eclipse depths. I also refit published brightness temperatures from Garhart et al. (2020) using a hierarchical model.
